# The Odin Project - Project: Admin Dashboard

## Description
A responsive admin dashboard written in HTML and CSS for the admin dashboard project in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
This page is responsive but optimized for desktop only. It will be updated to be responsive in all devices after I learn media query.
The purpose of this project is to practice making a admin dashboard template page with CSS Grid. You can also try the project yourself [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard)!
